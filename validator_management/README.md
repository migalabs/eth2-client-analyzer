# Validator Management in a Raspberry PI

The goal of this script is to test how validator keys and slashing protection can be imported and exported between the different Eth2 CL clients
To run experiments please use launcher loop file, which is the most updated one.
You may need to change the name of the launcher files for Lodestar.

# Setup

Please keep in mind that we have used [EthereumonARM](https://ethereum-on-arm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kiln/kiln-testnet.html#).
Additionally we have installed [Lodestar](https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/install/source/) and Grandine, which were not included in the ISO image.
You may use the files included in this repository to reproduce the same behaviour as the experiment we have performed.
